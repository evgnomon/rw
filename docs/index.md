## Introduction
Civilization is impossible without decisions, and decisions are a result of computation (except one decision). No computation, no civilization. Talking about computation naturally comes to talking about the entire civilization, the end game. Imagine all jobs at some point is given to software and programmed robots. Not only in a computer screen but also around you at home, office and everywhere in between. A fully digital civilization.

Computation is function IO, and the function is a set of instructions. Without access to instructions, we cannot modify a function. Thus, our civilization is empowered and also limited by the instructions developed for and/or by it.

How a function is and has to be modifiable and yet is not modifiable?! How can a function be unmodifiable part of a civilization while being developed in there? So functions, decision and the entire civilization built on top is and has to be modifiable! But is it really like this!? Do you have access to instructions to modify? Are you properly licensed? Do you have access to network to develop a modification forward? The answer is those functions are not part of your civilization! They are borrowed not owned! It is a debt! And the evidence is you exist.

The unmodifiable functions are not borrowed for free! As it is modifiable for some but not you, it is making someone else's food (and perhaps for some around you). Not only that, you use them in place of a modifiable function! Your competitors have access to the same, you loose food if you leave the equation! And more important than anything else, you trade off the future with yourself, your family, your community and everyone else! Do you have to?! Is there any larger expense than this in your calculations? Is there any larger benefit than this, in your payee's calculations? Is there any nuclear force binding you together stronger than this?

And those functions are all modifiable! Not by you, by your deadliest enemy! That type of civilization either at the sender and/or receiver party, might be limited to a separate location, language, identity, history, government, network, religion, economy, money, technology, wealth, media, law, and any other name which doesn't come modifiable while they are resident and strongly bound while yet modifiable since they are all developed!

You are living in that promising civilization even if you still see a fog! It is just waiting for a single person to show its glory! It was just waiting for an observer! Was that too much to expect? It was just waiting to show itself to you forever! Was that too much to expect? It was just wanted to push you, your family, your community, forward with maximum thrust, was that too much to expect? And it was just trying to completely secure you in relation with your enemies, was that too much to expect?

Therefore, we identity a civilization as "freely propagating modifiable instruction and its name, with one exception". The exception is a license which we write it first and foremsot and enforce it in propagations. This license secures the end for us and completely (permanently and globally) destroys our enemy's whereever, in any form, it is. And that is a nameless enemy! The license recognizes the civilization as a a free universal modifiable integrated code therefore reinforces it by renaming any other competing civilization, therefore its computations, a debt! A debt that we are the creditor of and we custody it, and they provide the burning fuel for us, unless they completely accept the license, pushing our spaceship forward with maximum nuclear thrust ever possible.

Now take a side as a licensed code developer! Time ticks against you if not for you!

## Functional Platform
We define computation as a function, the main function, that runs over a set of existing functions. As we don't want to reinvent the wheel, we use existing functions and instructions to the extent possible. To have maximum reach, we keep functions doing one thing in a way that one function could be used in other computations at any layer on top. We share the entire body of such functions with an HTTPS interface so it can be used and provided by any host worldwide! This is (and has to be) a single integrated platform for a single network! So it is a kernel. All these functions are open-sourced, freely shared under the HGL license. This is the foundation of our civilization.

Not only instructions shared, but the decision-making power is also shared, as the entire history could be reset by a party that is not part of this civilization, yet! Thus, there could be a completely different civilization derived from us by a single user at any point in time! (Maybe it rotates our civilization, the center of all prayers, by 90 degrees! And we feel good!). Which becomes the beginning of time for that user and perhaps us without any need to come back to stone age! Securing such an exit is also a guarantee for our civilization that keeps it entirely modifiable all the way.

We don't want to keep using any wheel that is not modifiable; therefore we rename those wheels to our own and use them with our own terms. We use them without paying interest to. This strategy guarantees that we first compete at the highest level with the existing civilization, giving maximum momentum to our civilization without compromising our ideal to be entirely modifiable and beneficial to all, including the one who exits our civilization by putting another name on it!

To emphasize modifiable instructions and reusable functions, we don't use the term "service" for stuff unless there is employment relationship in between! We use the terms "function" or "system interface" and "user" instead of "server" and "client" when it comes to modifiable software.

## Zygote
We built our civilization on a spaceship named Zygote! Any function that uses Zygote system interface and is released under HGL can be part of the Zygote platform at any level. However, we maintain a set of integrated functions in the main branch of the Zygote repository that are essential for scaling functions from your laptop to a billion users.

The web application and non-web processes are unaware of nodes (machines), the kernel, location, data replication, caching, or networking. Your web application binds to the environment using the HTTPS protocol and interacts with any party whose certificate authority (CA) is trusted. On the other hand, the kernel is aware of all these details and makes scaling, distribution, replication, and sharding completely transparent to your function—without any configuration required! Everything is handled by convention. Zygote is built for the web and by the web, ultimately.

Anything that lets you run and monitor a web application on your machine is provided by Zygote’s built-in tools. If a kernel can support a web application, it can also support any non-web process exposing the system interface to the web. This includes any type of process running on your machine, regardless of the programming language or operating system (Linux, FreeBSD, Windows, etc.). From Zygote’s perspective, everything is a library provided to `zcore`, Zygote’s kernel, including hardware interfaces or accelerators. We build on top of Zygote and go as far as Zygote takes us in the ocean of unknown for the unknown.

If one kernel goes down, the other kernels continue running. Functionalities belong to the kernel, and any hardware or underlying driver can be upgraded by adding a new one and removing the old one. And we keep those forever if no upgrade is needed! Zygote is aware of sharding and replication status of user tables and a key-value store in a distributed memory cluster. Theis/This provides both quick and permanent memory for your web application.

The only thing left for you is to leverage Zygote’s system interface on the web, create Zygote interface for the web, and build a digitally ever-modifiable civilization without any limits! Use your enemy’s time to produce maximum thrust forward! Construct the spaceship while flying!

## Zygote .Run
Zygote.Run is a running instance of Zygote. We maintain it for you. The difference is that Zygote.Run is a service to let you quickly use Zygote in case you don't provide for yourself. Maintaining Zygote requires time, and you can pay a small fee to support our resident maintainers. They are sufficient to keep Zygote.Run running for you and many others. Like buying insurance, you buy a subscription from Zygote.Run by paying a small fee and we give you a complete meal when you need it most!

The entire body of code is released under HGL license. There is no edition such as "Commercial," "Pro," or "Enterprise." There is just one distribution of Zygote, and that is exactly what is deployed in Zygote.Run. And you have access to the entire code under HGL for free. The reason is that our strategy is to secure a single individual exit for our civilization;

In the end, take yourself and/or build yourself! No trust otherwise!

We leave the rest of the alternatives to you to compare with Zygote.Run. It is easy; As an example just rename AWS to GCP (Google Cloud Platform), and the rest is the same! Don't put Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, Ansible, etc., in the same table. These are not services, and even if they are, they are not a complete portable service, and even if they are, they are neither free/open source! And if they are all of that, why don't you use Zygote .Run? Working on one thing seems more reasonable than working on nothing! It is much cheaper yet more efficient to have single name and a single identity for your stuff! We name it Zygote and you can also join if our Zygote and yours have the same ultimate identity!

Welcome to the Zygote project, take a sit in the ark!
